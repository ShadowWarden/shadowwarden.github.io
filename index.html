	As you walk toward the shining orb, you suddenly feel yourself pulled into a sparkling tunnel that deposits you into a chaotic mess of random ideas. Your party is now in the pocket dimension of Omkar Ramachandran - and your mage realizes that she's used up her only memorized Plane Shift
	<p> 
	While your mage takes a long rest to get back her level 7 spell slots, the rest of your group decides to observe the denizens of this strange realm - I can *mostly* gurantee that they will not <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_terms#T>TPK</a> you. 
	</p>
	<p>
	As you look toward the center of the hallway, you notice a simulated projection of a <a href=https://shadowwarden.github.io/GRPathTracer/>Schwarzchild Black Hole</a>. On the far side you see what appears to be a highly simplistic image of the <a href=https://github.com/ShadowWarden/wavesim>2D Wave Equation</a>. *Insert party name here* what do wish to do?
